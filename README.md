This simple, one file python program visualises data registered from lidar devices. If at least one person will find useful/helpful that will make my day.
The program scans the folder for CSV files with *data* in the filename. It calculates the range of data, draws the points, draws red lines representing borders, draws green lines from points to 0,0 assuming it was the only lidar position, then draws a scale.
Example data files is included.
